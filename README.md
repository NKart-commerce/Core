# NKart

NKart is a highly configurable, open source eCommerce package for multiple .NET-based content management systems, primarily [Umbraco CMS](http://www.umbraco.com).
Plans are in place to support other .NET-based content management systems - please submit issues if you want your particular CMS supported.

## Basic features

NKart comes with the following core features, but it's also built so you can expand on it to your needs. Here's what you get right out of the box:

* Products with options and variants
* Flat rate shipping provider (by weight or price) for a single warehouse that can be adjusted by country and region
* Cash, Paypal, Purchase & Braintree payment providers
* Both invoicing and orders, created with each purchase
* Multiple currencies
* Product Picker datatype for Umbraco that lets you connect your Merchello product with your Umbraco content.
* Extended Content on Products and Options (Similar to Nested Content) - Use existing Umbraco property editors on your products and options.
* Products & Sales Collections - Organise your products and sales efficiently
* Discounts
* Reports

## Downloading

Packages will be released via Nuget once stable releases are available - at present, this project is in active development & releases will only be available once stability is confirmed across multiple platforms.

## Documentation / Website

Documentation will be available in due course at (https://docs.nkart.io).

## Contribute

For now, contribution is restricted to a few trusted members who understand the architecture and are able to disassemble it from being wired to Umbraco.
If you think you can help with that effort, please email (hello@jamiehowarth.me) to discuss your potential to contribute to the project.

## Bugs

Bugs can be filed under the Issues tab.
This project will continue to be open-source under an MIT license, but support will only be offered for bug-fixes. 
Feature requests will require a support contract to be in place (pricing, details & how to purchase to be announced soon).
